# Queen Anne's Lace

This project creates **ethereal, generative art** inspired by *Queen Anne’s Lace* — a wildflower known for its fractal geometry, radial symmetry, and star-like dome of clustered blossoms.

Built with **p5.js**, this sketch simulates the flower's growth and structure using cycles, noise, and procedural clustering.

## Inspiration

Queen Anne's Lace has radial symmetry with clustered blossoms. This sketch attempts to recreate that using sine/cosine waves and randomness.
